## About the Game

 This is based on the [priority table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PsjYHSjpkEd93befvA1K19NNcMIQXafpii335XWuzM/edit#gid=1225283067).
 
  ~~You can see the priority table whenever you want.~~
  
  Do not see the priority table, since you type monster names as your answer (From version 3 or later)!

 ~~Not seeded, thus you can un-spoiler tag when you upload your answers~~

  Now this is seeded! You can play the Daily Necro-wordle!

## How to play

  The best way is to play it on [here](https://shortcakesweets.github.io/necro-wordle/). This page will update every time I commit.

  If you want to use the code or debug then;

  Download this repository, Or you could just download the [Version4 Folder](https://github.com/shortcakesweets/necro-wordle/tree/main/Version4), or [Version5 Folder](https://github.com/shortcakesweets/necro-wordle/tree/main/Version5)
  
  To run the game you only need these two files : *Necro-wordle.exe*, *Necro-wordle.pck*
  
  To actually see the code and debug, You should download latest version Godot Engine. (It's free)

## Reminder

  If you get the name wrong but the priority right, it's considered as a correct answer.
  
  > For example, "locked chest mimic" and "white chest mimic" has the same priority. If one of them is the answer, Either will also be the answer.

  Some enemies do not follow the general rules of priority.
  
  > "red dragon" has priority of 99999999, "leprechaun" has priority of 80000000.

  There are some *meme* names that you can type!
