## About the Game

 This is based on the [priority table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13PsjYHSjpkEd93befvA1K19NNcMIQXafpii335XWuzM/edit#gid=1225283067).
 
  You can see the priority table whenever you want.

 Not seeded, thus you can un-spoiler tag when you upload your answers

## How to play

  Download this repository, Or you could just download the [Version3 Folder](https://github.com/shortcakesweets/necro-wordle/tree/main/Version3).
  
  To run the game you only need these two files : *Necro-wordle.exe*, *Necro-wordle.pck*
  
  To actually see the code and debug, You should download latest version Godot Engine. (It's free)

## Reminder

  If you get the name wrong but the priority right, it's considered as a correct answer.
  
  > For example, "locked chest mimic" and "white chest mimic" has the same priority. If one of them is the answer, Either will also be the answer.

  Some enemies do not follow the general rules of priority.
  
  > "red dragon" has priority of 99999999, "leprechaun" has priority of 80000000.

  There are some *meme* names that you can type!
