## About the Game

## How to play

  The best way is to play it on [here](https://shortcakesweets.github.io/necro-wordle/).

  If you want to use the code or debug then download this repository, and open the project with Godot Engine.

## Reminder

  Mobs that has priority same or larger than 8 digits are excluded from game. You can see whether the enemy appears on autocomplete to see it's included or not.

  If you get the name wrong but the priority right, it's considered as a correct answer.
  
  > For example, "locked chest mimic" and "white chest mimic" has the same priority. If one of them is the answer, Either will also be the answer.

  Some enemies do not follow the general rules of priority.
  
  > "red dragon" has priority of 99999999, "leprechaun" has priority of 80000000.
